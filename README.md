# Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier

In this Project created a classifier which can and predict whether the it is a image of a dog or a cat.</br>
Convolution Neural Network a Deep Learning Algorithm is used for  the classification.
1. First applied the basic CNN and got the accuracy between 70-80%.
2. Next did some data augmentation and then again applied CNN which resulted with the accuracy between 80-90%.
3. Finally used Transfer Learning and applied the pretrained VGG16 CNN model and got the accuracy around 98%.

### Tranfer Learning:- It is technique used to increase the accuracy and avoid the overfitting of the model. A pretrained model such as VGGNET or GOOGLENET is used as the of the CNN model and the fullu connected network is then manipulated according to the user.This results in the growth fo accuracy.
